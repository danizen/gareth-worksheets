/*
 * Comments
 * --------
 * There are 2 kinds of comment in JavaScript - block level comments like this one.
 */
// This is a line oriented comment

// Programmers use comments to explain what they are doing

/*
Sometimes it takes more than one line to explain
something, and that is OK.
*/

// It is generally a bad idea to put too much code (or comment text) on one line because it gets hard to read and even harder to write.  Your editor may start showing it as multiple lines.
